            <p>Remember the 2006 Hollywood film <em>Outsourced</em>? The protagonist Todd flew all the way from the US
                to a small town in India to set up a call centre for his company.</p>
            <p>This was pretty much how things worked back in the early 2000s—while globalisation had enabled
                multinational corporations to take advantage of lower wages in countries like India, a sizeable
                managerial workforce had to be shipped out as expats to get the job done. From setting up the
                infrastructure to training agents,&nbsp;there was no real remote alternative.</p>
            <p>Today’s Todds, however, needn’t even leave their desks: digital-era technology lets you set up and run
                modern-day call centres remotely from anywhere on the globe. Bye-bye, expat culture. Hello, VoIP-enabled
                contact centres.</p>
            <p>It makes sense for businesses of all sizes to switch to a cloud-based contact centre given the popularity
                they have gained recently. The global contact centre market is valued at $339.4 billion and is expected
                to reach a whopping <a

            <p>Call centres have existed since the 1900s. During their heyday, telephone operators had only one goal: to
                sell. These operators or ‘early’ agents were given a list of numbers to cold-call, hoping to strike a
                deal.</p>
            <p>Thus, the earliest call centres were strictly outbound. Things however changed with the invention of the
                <a href="https://www.acefone.com/solutions/free-phone-number/">toll-free number</a>. These numbers were
                programmed to not cost the caller a penny, inviting more inbound calls. With this, the scope of call
                centres expanded beyond outbound sales to include support and inbound sales.
            </p>
            <p>Things remained this way until the Internet revolution, when for the first time call centres faced
                obsoletion. Traditional centres were limited to on-premise operations and defined by heavy
                infrastructure.</p>
            <p>They could in no way keep up with the pace at which companies were expanding in the new world. Offices
                had to multiply fast. People were shifting to smartphones and laptops, which traditional centres didn’t
                directly support.</p>
            <p>This gave rise to modern-day call centres that existed entirely on the cloud, ran on any device, and
                could be easily operated via a portal: <a
                    href="https://www.acefone.com/solutions/inbound-contact-centre/">contact centres</a>.</p>
            <p>Soon enough, contact centres become the preferred customer support and sales apparatus for businesses.
                The pandemic was the final step in this transition.</p>
            <p>Today’s contact centres provide omnichannel communication to customers, empowering them to reach out to
                businesses using email, chat, SMS, calls, social media, etc. Businesses, similarly, benefit from the
                large number of features contact centres offer at a cost-effective rate.</p>

                designed to receive incoming communications from customers and potential leads. They mainly provide
                support to individuals who engage with your business, i.e., those who have purchased a product or
                service from your company.</p>
            <p>At the same time, they can be used as an effective inbound sales tool. For instance, companies can
                promote offers on different channels such as their website or landing page, and list a toll-free number
                for lead inquiries.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, inbound contact centres are equipped to handle all sorts of customer queries, ranging from
                setting up the product to issues arising through daily usage.</p>

            <p>With the increased use of data analytics to drive business decisions, outbound centres are also now using

            <p>With customers using an average of 3-4 channels to interact with companies, a multichannel centre is a
                must. Multichannel contact centres provide support via calls, SMS, social media, mobile apps, website
                portals, chatbots, and more.</p>
            <p>If you’re new in the market and looking to establish a presence, we suggest investing in a multichannel
                contact centre. Your competitors may not exploit multiple mediums right from the start, so you can gain
                quite the advantage through this endeavour.</p>
            <p>Omnichannel contact centres are similar to multichannel contact centres. They, however, have managed to
                combine all communication channels into a unified platform. This unification makes it easier for contact
                centres to make customer experiences more personalised. This helps immensely with customer retention.

            <p>With the advancement in modern contact centres, however, many of these issues have been addressed. For
                instance, modern centres let supervisors, managers, and agents access the same portal for operations and
                analytics. This assures great control, as everything has one digital address.</p>
            <p>At the same time, to operate traditional centres, you&nbsp;have to start from scratch—assembling a team,
                buying the technology, training the agents, etc.</p>
            <p>Modern virtual contact centres are equipped with all the security provisions you need, be it 256-bit
                industry-grade security or antivirus protection at all levels. There are even multiple data centres
                where your data is backed up. At a traditional call centre, on the other hand, all your data is present
                in one place and any calamity can result in its destruction.</p>
            <p>Most modern contact centres promise a minimum of 99.99% uptime and can transport the highest quality
                calls via VoIP.</p>
            <p>Put simply, cloud contact centres are the go-to solution for SMBs. Not only do you save costs, your
                systems will always be up-to-date with the latest software and technologies.</p>

                connection and a device, such as a computer or phone, to work. This makes them independent of the
                complex machinery, physical servers, and hardphones that traditional call centres require. So you
                needn’t invest much in infrastructure and hardware set-up.</p>
            <p>In fact, the onboarding experience simply implies remote installation of the software on your device and
                aligning your current tools and hardware with the contact centre. Together, these processes make contact
                centres affordable for all business sizes.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Remember the <em>Outsourced</em> example we gave above? Now imagine this: You could be a company located
                in the US that wants to build a presence in India. So, you hire a group of agents and a manager in
                India, all of whom are equipped with laptops. Then, give you them a contact centre solution and a
                ‘softphone’ app that they can easily set up on their devices.</p>
            <p>The softphone will let them make calls anywhere in the world. Thereon, you forward support calls and
                ensure that your customers are always looked after.</p>
            <p>You can repeat this process and set up a contact centre anywhere in the world, complete with local
                numbers that give you a local presence.</p>

            <p>Contact centres are based on cloud technology. This means any upgrade or change in technology will simply
                require a software update. The technology improves day-by-day, without any charges for the updates.</p>
            <p>Contact centres, due to their digital nature, can easily be integrated with other SaaS tools such as CRMs
                and helpdesk apps. Some of these include&nbsp; Pipedrive, Zendesk, ZohoCRM, and Hubspot. <a

                    6 features every contact centre needs</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Every contact centre provider will offer you many features with your solution—but how will you prioritise
                these? Hence, we have gathered a list of must-have features for contact centres that SMBs can benefit
                from.</p>
            <h3><span id="interactive-voice-response">Interactive voice response</span>
            </h3>
            <p>An interactive voice response system or IVR is critical to all inbound processes. It refers to a
                pre-recorded calling menu that a user can interact with as soon as they call you. This menu helps them
                link to different departments with ease, access self-service queries, and even make requests. No inbound
                contact centre is complete without a calling menu.</p>
            <p>Here’s how it works: You open the IVR builder tool that most contact centre providers include with their
                portal. You then upload a script, complete with recordings and instructions. For instance, press ‘1’ to
                get latest product information, ‘2’ to connect with the billing department, and 3 to talk to a support
                agent directly. You can even add on-hold music.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <h3><span id="multi-device-support">Multi-device support</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Portability is critical these days, even for sales and support agents, many of whom are constantly on the
                move. With most companies introducing hybrid work for their employees, agents need to be able to work as
                efficiently from their homes as they do in the office.</p>
            <p>The best contact centre providers will always have apps that support calling and other features across
                devices such as smartphones, tablets and desktops. Equally important are custom apps catered to each
                device and the possibility to shift between devices even during live calls via features such as call
                flipping.</p>
            <h3><span id="call-features">Call features</span>
            </h3>
            <p>As per <a
                    href="https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/call-center-stats/#:~:text=9.%2059%25%20of%20them%20prefer%20communicating%20their%20questions%20and%20issues%20via%20live%20calls."
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>, 59% callers prefer to discuss their concerns over
                live calls over other mediums. Therefore, ensure that your contact centre solution offers sufficient
                calling tools and features to make your callers’ experience better. Some <a
                    href="https://acefone.com/features">relevant features</a> include&nbsp;call recording, live call
                transfer, call whispering, call barging, and skill-based routing.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SwastikaDkl/how-can-call-recording-improve-your-customer-service-225048865"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call recording</a> lets you re-listen to key points from customer
                conversations, gauge how your agents performed and strategise improvements accordingly. Live call
                transfer allows agents to transfer calls to supervisors and other agents. Call whispering is a vital
                feature that lets managers make suggestions to agents during live calls without the caller being aware
                of it.</p>
            <h3><span id="predictive-dialers">Predictive dialers</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Predictive dialers ensure you do not have to waste time calling clients and potential leads manually.</p>
            <p>You simply upload a contact list to the dialer tool and wait as the tool calls multiple numbers for you,
                as per your configuration. The dialer is programmed to identify genuine calls and avoid missed, spam,
                and busy calls. Only when a genuine connection has been made, will the call be forwarded to the agent.
            </p>
            <p>Dialers also monitor operator availability and route calls accordingly. They help you minimise call drop
                rates.</p>
            <p>At Acefone, we offer two types of predictive dialers—ratio dialers and preview dialers. To know more
                about them, get in touch with our experts.</p>
            <h3><span id="automatic-call-distribution">Automatic call distribution</span>
            </h3>
            <p>This feature lets you route calls to the appropriate department or agent, which reduces your customer
                wait time and encourages first-call resolution. Top contact centre providers have various ACD strategies
                and techniques in place for you to exploit.</p>
            <p>For instance, if a customer calls to complain about a product, they get directed to an agent in the
                product support department. If callers have billing&nbsp;issues, they’re routed to the accounts
                department, and waiting calls are connected to idle agents.</p>
            <h3><span id="reporting-and-analytics">Reporting and analytics</span>
            </h3>
            <p>While many provide analytics and data reporting, the best providers let you customise data and present it
                as convenient graphs and tables. They also provide a vast array of performance indicators for your
                supervisors to access.</p>
            <p>Your managers and stakeholders can monitor agent performance, evaluate call quality, identify hiccups,
                and contribute towards the overall improvement of processes via reporting and analytics.</p>
            <p>You will also find a list of key performance indicators that Acefone provides later on in this article.

            <p>It’s one thing to have a contact centre, and another to run it&nbsp;successfully. Therefore, we came up
                with a list of factors that are critical for the success of your contact centre.</p>
            <h3><span id="always-stay-updated">Always. Stay. Updated.</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Empower your agents with the latest software and tools, but do not be resistant to new updates and
                technology changes. Thanks to VoIP, keeping up with upgrades and the latest software becomes easy, and
                these updates will always help your agents communicate better. You can update every tool and extension
                with only a few clicks, or enable auto-updates.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="unified-communication">Unified communication</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Unified communication allows agents to manage and switch between multiple channels through a single
                cloud-based platform. This way, customers can get in touch with your company easily, and you can reply
                to them there and then.</p>

            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="customer-centricity">Customer centricity</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Customer centricity is all about putting your customers first. Use analytics, tools, integrations, and
                the various features your contact centre provides to constantly improve services for your
                customers.&nbsp; Gather customer insight and feedback, and use them to understand their pain points and
                design processes accordingly.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="better-trained-agents">Better trained agents</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Your agents form the bridge between you and your customers, and a contact centre is only as successful as
                its agents. You must ensure they have enough training so that they can service&nbsp;clients better and
                convert more leads.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="great-management">Great management</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Teams can work more efficiently with optimal supervision and goals in sight. Use the live dashboard
                to&nbsp;keep track of your contact centre. See what your agents are up to by accessing call recordings,
                and be present for them via features like whisper, barge, and call tracking.</p>
            <h3><span id="setting-goals">Setting goals</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Contact centres offer plenty of reports and analytical features that let you keep track of performance on
                all levels. You can set goals using those analytical inputs, which are important for agents as they
                provide them a plan of action.</p>
            <p>By setting goals, you can also reward agents and give them something to work towards. Some of the more
                agent-centric indicators include first-call resolution, average handling time, and customer satisfaction
                score.</p>

            </h2>
            <p aria-level="2">There is no magic to contact centres. They are as much susceptible to failure as other
                solutions are, so it is critical to have the right team working towards the right goal. Here are some
                things to keep in mind while hiring your agents.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="ideal-agent-profile">Ideal agent profile</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Begin with creating an ideal agent profile, consisting of key skills and attributes that your contact
                centre needs. To identify those, you can study your current top-performing agents and note their best
                skills and attributes.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="communication-skills">Communication skills</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Your agents should be able to communicate well with customers over every channel—be it voice, chat, or
                SMS. This is irrespective of whichever channel your centre deals with. Some of the key communication
                skills that agents must possess are active listening, empathy, compassion, and confidence.</p>
            <h3 aria-level="2"><span id="pre-employment-assessments">Pre-employment Assessments</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Once you know which skills you’re looking for, adequately assess those skills by including relevant
                questionnaires and tests in your recruitment process. These assessments can include tests that evaluate
                the candidates’ technical skills, temperament, and social skills.</p>
            <h2 class="acetoc-head-elem" id="acetoc-head-elem7"><span id="how-to-measure-your-agents-performance">How to
                    measure your agents’ performance</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Today’s cloud contact centres present an array of key performance indicators and analytics that managers
                can use to track and improve their contact centre’s performance. These metrics help businesses define
                and stick to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Keep in mind the below mentioned indicators; over 65% of

            </h3>
            <p>Customers don’t like to call multiple times for the same query.&nbsp;Hence, a high fist-call resolution
                rate is a great indicator for the efficiency of your contact centre.</p>
            <h3><span id="abandoned-call-rates">Abandoned call rates</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Customer calls that disconnect before being answered&nbsp;are always a bad sign for a contact centre.
                This can mean your centre has an inefficient call management system, leading to long queues and hold
                times for customers.</p>
            <h3><span id="average-handling-time-aht">Average handling Time (AHT)</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Customers like&nbsp;quick resolution to their issues. But, call centre agents can take a long time to
                assist them. Thus, tracking the call time of individual agents can help improve overall efficiency.</p>
            <h3><span id="call-transfer-rate">Call transfer rate</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Customers can get frustrated repeating the same issues to different service agents.&nbsp;More than <a

                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% customers prefer to speak to a single agent</a> to resolve their
                issues. Thus, contact centre agents must be trained to handle queries efficiently and transfer calls

            </h3>
            <p>A good CSAT score can help you get great word-of-mouth from existing customers. It lets customers rate
                their experience and contact centres to improve their services using these metrics.</p>

                    the future of contact centres?</span>
            </h2>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot of business operations. What was done merely three years ago is now
                seen as the older way of doing things. This is true in the case of contact centres too.</p>
            <h3><span id="contact-centres-are-going-virtual">Contact centres are going virtual</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Thanks to the cloud, businesses could quickly get back on track after the world had gone into strict
                quarantine. And despite being confined indoors&nbsp;for over a year, they did not lose out on
                productivity.</p>
            <p>In fact, <a
                    href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/whats-next-for-remote-work-an-analysis-of-2000-tasks-800-jobs-and-nine-countries"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> have now listed several jobs that can completely go
                remote, while the others can opt for hybrid working. One such is the role of contact centre agents.</p>
            <p>As traditional communication methods fall flat when compared to the cloud, businesses are beginning to
                take note. Rather than setting up clunky, traditional offices, the future represents a more
                ergonomic&nbsp;space for these agents.</p>
            <p>Moreover, with cloud services becoming industry standards, switching to a virtual contact centre is only
                a matter of time.</p>
            <h3><span id="self-service-will-continue-to-rise">Self-service will continue to rise</span>
            </h3>
            <p>A<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> study in the
                    Harvard Business Review</a> discovered that “across industries, 81% of all customers attempt to take
                care of matters themselves before reaching out to a live representative.”</p>
            <p>This continues to align with the increasing demand of self-service options by customers. These include
                AI-enabled chatbots for quick FAQs, IVR systems with voice recognition software to assist in all sorts
                of customer queries, and many more.</p>
            <h3><span id="man-machine-mix">Man-machine-mix</span>
            </h3>
            <p>While automation has swept across almost every industry, contact centres have always been&nbsp;wary
                of&nbsp;complete automation. This is because, when it comes to quality service, the human touch still
                reigns supreme. But, the advantages and benefits of automated tools cannot be ignored. &nbsp;Thus, while
                automation is ‘in’ right now, the hybrid model of man and machine for contact centres is gaining
                popularity too.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>With this guide, we covered the fundamentals of contact centres to help you set up your first contact
                centre with ease. It covers their evolution from traditional call centres to contact centres, their
                importance for today’s businesses, features, ability to track performance, and plenty more.</p>
            <p>The bottom-line is, to be able to run a contact centre successfully, you must focus on three key aspects:
                your team, the service, and customer experience. If these things are central to your process, there is
                no way a contact centre will fail you.</p>
